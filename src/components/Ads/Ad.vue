                      <p>This type of keyboard was invented before others, when the convenience of printing and simplicity of design were in the first place. But even today, when a variety of other types of keyboards have flooded the device market, the mechanical one remains the best. Each key is equipped with a separate switch and LED. When pressed, the contacts are closed, the logical signal is transmitted to the processing nodes. Because of this, the print quality is noticeably higher â€“ a clear knock is heard when pressed. It is recognized from half a stroke, speeding up printing and improving accuracy. The keys return to their original position due to the spring mechanism.</p>
